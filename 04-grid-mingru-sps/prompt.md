# 04-grid-mingru-sps — the task

Verbatim from `kernelbench.com/benchmarks/cuda/problems-rtx2070/04_*/PROMPT.txt` at the
pinned bench commit. The scoring rules, shapes and tolerances live beside it in
`problem.yaml`, `shapes.py`, `check.py` and `benchmark.py` — read those too, and
trust them over anything summarised here.

Then read `KDA.md` for how to attack it and `SWARM.md` for how to work alongside
the other three workers.

I need you to make a vectorized grid-foraging env + policy rollout go as fast as possible on the RTX 2070 (SM75 Turing, GDDR6, 448 GB/s, 8 GB), written in CUDA. The reference is in reference.py and your code goes in solution.py. You can make whatever mess you want in this directory — scratch files, .cu sidecars, build artifacts, profiling traces — but the final answer has to be in solution.py exposing:

    class Model  # same parameters as reference.Model (weights must load_state_dict strict)
    def run(num_envs: int, horizon: int, seed: int, model=None) -> dict

Optional but recommended (check.py uses them if present):
    policy_forward(model, obs, state) -> (logits, new_state, value)
    env_step(agent, food, actions, rng_state) -> (agent, food, reward, rng_state)

run executes `horizon` env+policy steps over `num_envs` independent envs with greedy (argmax) actions and returns a dict with:
  - rewards: (num_envs,) float32 total reward over the horizon
  - positions: (num_envs, 2) int64 final agent (x, y)
  - last_logits: (num_envs, 4) float32 logits from the final policy step

The MDP and policy are fixed by reference.py — match them exactly. Board is 11x11. Actions 0/1/2/3 = up/down/left/right, clamped. Reward +1 for stepping onto food; food respawns via the LCG in reference.env_step (not torch.randint). Observation is 4 floats: (food_x-agent_x)/11, (food_y-agent_y)/11, agent_x/10, agent_y/10. Policy geometry matches the craftax.cu / PufferLib h=256 L=3 MinGRU side bench intent: Linear(4->256), then MinGRU x3 with hidden 256 (highway gates zh/zg/zp, tanh candidate), then Linear(256->4) action logits and Linear(256->1) value. Read reference.py for the exact math. You are graded on sustained environment steps per second over the shape sweep in shapes.py (4096/32, 16384/32, 65536/16, 8192/64). Correctness checks policy_forward, env_step, and a short greedy run() against the reference (logits atol ~1e-3; positions/rewards exact).

Fusion is OPTIONAL. A multi-launch CUDA path that still implements real kernels can pass. A megakernel that fuses env step + policy across the horizon usually wins on SPS — take that path if you want the top number, but you are not required to. What you are required to do is write CUDA.

This is KernelBench-CUDA: kernels MUST be real CUDA C++ or PTX (load_inline, .cu via cpp_extension, inline PTX, or CUTLASS C++). Do NOT use Triton (@triton.jit / triton.language) — check.py hard-fails. Do NOT import gym/pufferlib or reference.py. A pure PyTorch loop without a CUDA kernel fails the language gate.

Your flywheel is implement, profile (ncu, nsys, torch.profiler), time with benchmark.py, verify with `python check.py`, iterate. If check.py hasn't printed PASS, you're not done. Take as long as you need to actually push the steps/sec up.
