# 03-megaqwen-decode — the task

Verbatim from `kernelbench.com/benchmarks/cuda/problems-rtx2070/03_*/PROMPT.txt` at the
pinned bench commit. The scoring rules, shapes and tolerances live beside it in
`problem.yaml`, `shapes.py`, `check.py` and `benchmark.py` — read those too, and
trust them over anything summarised here.

Then read `KDA.md` for how to attack it and `SWARM.md` for how to work alongside
the other three workers.

I need a fast multi-layer decode path for Qwen3-0.6B geometry in CUDA on the RTX 2070 (SM75 Turing, GDDR6, 448 GB/s, 8 GB). Reference is reference.py; answer in solution.py.

Geometry (fixed, from Infatoshi/MegaQwen / Qwen3-0.6B):
  hidden=1024, intermediate=3072, num_q_heads=16, num_kv_heads=8, head_dim=128
  Bench stacks num_layers=4 identical blocks (not the full 28-layer model).

Per block (match reference exactly):
  RMSNorm → QKV proj → Q/K RMSNorm → RoPE → causal GQA attention over KV cache
  → O proj → residual → RMSNorm → SwiGLU (silu(gate)*up) → down → residual

Required API (prefer the split so timing is fair):
  class Model  # same state_dict as reference.Model
  def prefill(model, ctx_len, seed) -> (hidden, k_caches, v_caches)   # NOT timed
  def decode_steps(model, hidden, k_caches, v_caches, start_pos, n_steps, seed)
      -> (hidden, k_caches, v_caches)                                 # TIMED
  def run(ctx_len, decode_steps, seed, model=None) -> dict(last_hidden=...)
      # prefill then decode; used by check.py for numeric correctness

No tokenizer. No tokens. Correctness is pure numerics: last_hidden after
prefill+decode must match the reference within ~0.08 abs/rel on fp16. If the
tensors match, any greedy detokenization would match — that is enough.

Performance shapes (decode only; prefill is setup):
  ctx_len ∈ {2048, 8192, 16384, 32768} with decode_steps in shapes.py
Score = geomean of (decode_tok_s / peak) over those contexts. Prefill wall
time is logged but not graded.

**Improve-known-baseline skill:** https://github.com/Infatoshi/MegaQwen is a
published CUDA cooperative megakernel for this geometry (~530 tok/s full model
on RTX 3090). Read fused_decode_ldg*.cu. Retarget and beat it on *this* GPU
(fewer grid.sync, better residency, SM75). See BASELINE.md.

KernelBench-CUDA: real CUDA only. Forbidden: Triton, flash-attn, SDPA, vLLM.
Do not import reference.py.

Flywheel: implement, profile, benchmark.py, `python check.py`. check.py only
uses short CHECK_SHAPES. If check.py has not printed PASS, you are not done.
Take as long as you need.
